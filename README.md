# dyslexic-bible

This is a simple [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) script to change the font of
[bible.com](https://www.bible.com/bible) to the [Dyslexie](https://www.dyslexiefont.com) font
and makes the page an off-white color.
You must have the font installed on your computer already.

To use with Chrome try
[Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo).

Once this script is installed, it will update automatically.
